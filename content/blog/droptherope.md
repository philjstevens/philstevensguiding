Winter is having its last gasps at the moment, with a few keen teams still wobbling their way up thin gully climbs on the Ben. I had a good haul this time round, I’m happy call it at this stage. Time to start looking forward to the summer. 

Climbing on Mingulay in the Bishop’s Isles, south of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, was a highlight for me last year. The island is an outpost of adventure climbing. There’s no mobile signal, in fact there’s barely even enough VHF signal to pick up the shipping forecast. No-one lives there any more - the ruined village on its eastern shore is a lasting testament to the old settlers who desperately clung on for a while but ultimately moved elsewhere.

Travel in is by a 4 hour ferry across the Hebridean Sea, carrying all food and equipment needed to be totally self sufficient for the duration. It took me two trips to get all my gear up the gangway – I just couldn’t sensibly lift it all without hurting myself.

The hour-and-a-half fishing boat transfer that follows the ferry is far from a sure thing. The boat is often unable to land you at your desired destination due to the bouncy sea state, and once dropped off it may not be possible to get picked up for several days. The boat might have to come back several days earlier than planned, it might have to come significantly later. The weather is king, your plans are nothing.

Loaded up like donkeys, skating around on slippery rocks, kit is slowly shuttled to an exposed windswept headland that offers the tiny wind-shadow of the old schoolhouse as the sole shelter from the Atlantic storms. A ragged shanty-town of canvas is established – another gang of dreamers naive enough to think they eke out an existence here.

Just getting around the island takes effort. The paths are faint and rough, with reasonable sized hills barring access to the main climbing areas - the 100m abseil rope needed to access the cliffs makes its presence felt.

On our trip in August last year it rained at least every 24 hours, many of the crags were infested with guano and angry seabirds, and we found a reasonable amount of loose rock in some fairly serious places. Why climb somewhere like that at all?

Well, if you want an easy climbing trip, go to the Peak District. 

Mingulay might not be an easy place, but it’s magical, and oh so worthy of the extra struggle. The rock is wonderful, grippy Gneiss that gives good friction even when wet – the Peak can keep its gritstone, Gneiss is the real deal. And the experience is a complete one – there’s no park ranger fun-policing here. Living in relative isolation with a group of friends is a riot. Go to bed when the whisky supplies are sufficiently dented, get up when the howling of seals wakes you.

Dun Mingulay showcases everything that’s best about the island. 80m of overhanging gneiss, projecting straight into the ocean. There’s no good platform at the base except in the calmest seas, no way to view the crag to see just how wild the sea is, no escape route below UK 5b, no way to raise any help from the coastguard in the event of a problem. Help would come primarily from the other teams on the island. Pippa and I took a look about three days in – I even went down a short way into the capping overhangs to get a better view. The base was getting a thorough pummelling from the Atlantic swell, so we went elsewhere.

The next day, things looked marginally calmer. We rigged the line, had a sandwich, then stopped procrastinating and got in there. 3 rope protectors and a lot of free-hanging abseiling later, I landed on the slab. It might as well have been the moon. I found a tiny pedestal with a helpful crack, right on the margins of the sea-spray, and got established ready for Pippa’s arrival.

Right up to this point, there’s no real commitment, not really. Jumaring out is a ball-ache, if the rope protectors aren’t set up right it could be quite risky, it’s always hard work, some potential climbing time has been burned, but you can get out. Once Pippa arrived, she took the rack and tied in. I kept the end of the ab line as she quested off – the start of the routes is often greasy, and I was reluctant to let go of our lifeline to the top.

Pippa weaved up the first pitch, overcoming a small overlap typical of Mingulay – exciting moves but good gear with reasonable holds never far away – to reach the first stance. The climbing ropes came tight; it was time.

As I dropped the end of the abseil rope, the wind gathered it from me and blew it away over the sea. I gazed at it fluttering 15m out of reach. The rope moved in a peculiar oscillating orbit around me, swinging to and fro but never returning to earth. At that moment, I felt like the architect of my own fate. Fully committed to the climb out, fully psyched, in control and loving every single minute.

The Barra Head isles aren’t for everyone, and I’m glad about that. It’s refreshing to know that genuine, unsanitised adventure can still be found so close to home. The island is a hard place, but the living is joyously simple. It’s serious, but if you have the right skills it is incredible fun too. The memories of outrageously steep yet jug-infested routes, delicate grippy slabs, angry seas, guano-encrusted traverses, laughter in the tent with friends, are still vivid. I need to go back.
